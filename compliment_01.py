1. On a scale of 1 to 10 (where 10 is the hardest), how would you rate this lab?
I would give this lab a 3 out of 10. Once you understand the if statement, it is pretty straight forward.



2. What was the hardest part of this lab?
Deciding what to name the vairiable for the input.. (The lab was pretty easy)
